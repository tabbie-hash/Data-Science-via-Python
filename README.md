# DATA SCIENCE WITH PYTHON
The files in this repository will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python data science libraries and introduce the 
abstraction of the `Series` and `DataFrame` as the central data structures for various statistical analysis and data visualizations. 

## Datasets and Libraries:
The datasets used here are extracted from Kaggle.
Some of the popular libraries used for data analysis- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `nltk`, `sklearn`, `wordcloud`, `plotly`

## Usage: 
These analytical works on various large datasets are performed independently by me to explore and derive inferences from different kinds of datasets available on opensource platform such as Kaggle.
